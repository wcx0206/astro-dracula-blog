Greetings! Welcome to my blog.

## About the Author

I'm Wcx, a student passionate about programming and embracing open-source projects.

I am an undergraduate student at the School of Software Engineering, Nanjing University. Inspired by the creator of this blog framework, I began building my own blog. I focus on backend development and cloud-native technologies, and I am enthusiastic about creating and enjoying the process of developing project demos.

## About the Blog

This blog serves as my platform for documenting my learning journey, sharing technical insights, and reflecting on life. The content here is diverse and includes:

* **Learning Notes**: My thoughts and reflections from coursework, covering both professional knowledge and interdisciplinary topics.
* **Technical Practices**: My experiments and summaries in backend development and cloud-native technologies, sharing practical experiences and lessons learned.
* **Life Essays**: Records of everyday life, capturing beautiful moments and personal insights.

The creator of this blog framework is my close friend, BlockLune, who is also a computer science student. Under his influence, I embarked on the path of technical creation. If you want to learn more about this blog framework, you can visit his [blog homepage](https://blocklune.cc/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/BlockLune).

This blog is built with Astro and integrates React components. The creator chose Astro mainly for its speed. The blog’s color scheme is inspired by Dracula. In addition, the creator used Tailwind CSS for styling and Tailwind Typography for typesetting. Motion (formerly Framer Motion) was also used to create some animation effects.
